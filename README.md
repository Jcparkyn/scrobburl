# Scrobburl

A multiplayer word game, where all state is stored in the URL (no backend needed!).
The twist? The game state is (will be) encoded so that _no player can cheat_ (modify state illegally, or predict/manipulate RNG).

Scrobburl is in **very early development**, and most features aren't implemented yet. This includes the URL encoding, but I do have a plan for how to do it.
